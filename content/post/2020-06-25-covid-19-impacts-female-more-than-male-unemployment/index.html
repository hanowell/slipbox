<p>According to a recent Brookings report <span class="citation">(Yildirmaz 2020)</span>, not only has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted US employment most among lower income groups. It also has impacted women more than men. Isn’t this different than the Great Recession, which impacted men’s more than women’s employment?</p>
