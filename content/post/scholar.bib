  author = {Gaebler, Johann and Cai, William and Basse, Guillaume},
  year = {2020},
  pages = {31},
  abstract = {In studies of discrimination, researchers often seek to estimate a causal effect of race or gender on outcomes. For example, in the criminal justice context, one might ask whether arrested individuals would have been subsequently charged or convicted had they been a different race. It has long been known that such counterfactual questions face measurement challenges related to omitted-variable bias, and conceptual challenges related to the definition of causal estimands for largely immutable characteristics. Another concern, raised most recently in Knox et al. [2020], is post-treatment bias. The authors argue that many studies of discrimination condition on intermediate outcomes, like being arrested, which themselves may be the product of discrimination, corrupting statistical estimates. Here we show that the Knox et al. critique is itself flawed, suffering from a mathematical error. Within their causal framework, we prove that a primary quantity of interest in discrimination studies is nonparametrically identifiable under a standard ignorability condition that is common in causal inference with observational data. More generally, though, we argue that it is often problematic to conceptualize discrimination in terms of a causal effect of protected attributes on decisions. We present an alternative perspective that avoids the common statistical difficulties, and which closely relates to long-standing legal and economic theories of disparate impact. We illustrate these ideas both with synthetic data and by analyzing the charging decisions of a prosecutor's office in a large city in the United States.},
  annote = {Outlines the three challenges to causal studies of discrimination:
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item hard to define the causal estimand for factors that cannot be manipulated, such as protected attributes, which makes it difficult to do experimental studies

\item important variables often omitted in observational studies due, for example, to lack of full information about incidence reports

\item post-treatment bias due to sample selection (e.g., discriminatory pre-arrest police behavior)

\end{enumerate}

\par
Knox et al. (cited) argue that problem three makes it impossible to study police discrimination because there is insufficient data on pre-arrest police behavior. The paper's authors argue that Knox et al. conduct a logical fallacy by assuming that a sufficient condition (discriminatory policing) is a necessary condition.},

\par
pg 7 explains a la Angela Davis that prison population in California grew rapidly between '82 and '00 even though crime peaked in 1980
\par
pg 11 starts the same review as Angela Davis of the history of prisons, notably as an outcome of reform against corporal punishment, but also a solution to rising population size and density. Gilmore explains that prison was, however, a meaningless punishment for those who weren't free to begin with, like Blacks and women.
\par
pg 12 introduces the idea that what count as crime changes strategically, as does what happens as a consequences of certain types of crime. Case in point: vagrancy laws after the Civil War; prohibition of alcohol; Jim Crow laws.
\par
pg 15 says states with lower prison growth rate show more rapidly diminishing crimes rates
\par
pg 16 cites research that imprisonment leads to higher rates of mental illness and missed opportunities among the current and previously incarcerated. In these disrupted places, when people need help, they dial 911 because the reliability of their community is diminished by these disruptions.
\par
pg 26 "Scholar activisim" is where the questions come from the grassroots but the research doesn't necessarily reinforce the grassroots view of how the world works.
\par
pg 26 Prisons are a response by the state to increasing social instability as the golden age of WWII-funded prosperity finally comes to an end.
\par
pgs 5 and 6 explain how Gilmore came to ask "Why prisons": realizing that the laws are written to put many people, especially people of color, behind bars.
\par
pgs 15-16 introduce the argument that removing people from communities disrupts social relationships. Cites Clear, Rose, and Clear, Comfort about community disruption.}
