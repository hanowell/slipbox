<p>I need to clarify something for (the very small number of) readers of my slipbox: these are notes, not posts. That means these thoughts may not yet be fully formed, and are certainly not thoroughly edited. There will by typos. There will be run-on sentences. If I publish something that is fully baked, I’ll make that clear in the post if it’s in this slipbox, or I’ll publish it in a completely different venue.</p>
