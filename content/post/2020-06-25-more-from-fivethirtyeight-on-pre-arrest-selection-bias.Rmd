A [new article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-statistics-dont-capture-the-full-extent-of-the-systemic-bias-in-policing/) in FiveThirtyEight by [Laura Bronner](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/laura-bronner/) [@bronnerWhyStatisticsDon2020] is a good illustration of how effective a toy example can be. By comparing two simple scenarios, she demonstrates what I was getting at in a [recent note](https://slipbox.hanowell.me/post/2020/06/24/gaebler-et-al-vs-knox-et-al-discriminatory-policing/) about that Gaebler et al. critique of Knox et al.: "Knowing how often police use force against people they've stopped is **not enough information**."
