<p>Seven days ago, I created this public slipbox. One of the issues with how I execute my slipbox is that its public. The other issue is that I do version-tracking with GitHub, and deploy using Netlify. These are issues because I work for Amazon, where they say “security is job zero” (with zero being a reference to zero-indexing that has benefits for many programming tasks). The solution I came up with is to create an Amazon-specific slipbox for notes that I can’t share outside of Amazon for security reasons. Here are the tenets (very Amazonian of me) for the slipbox:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The slipbox is for permanent notes that can’t go into my public slipbox for corporate security reasons.</li>
<li>The project notes are specific to a particular project and get archived once the project is complete.</li>
<li>The naming convention for a note URL will be “[slipbox root]/YYYY/MM/DD/[descriptive note slug]”.</li>
<li>Sometimes, project notes will emerge bottom-up from the slipbox.</li>
<li>As time goes on, I will create index pages to track lines of thought and projects.</li>
<li>Where appropriate, my Amazon-specific slipbox will reference my public slipbox, in which case I’ll include the note URL in the “Related notes” section of a note.</li>
<li>Where appropriate, my public slipbox will reference my Amazon-specific slipbox, in which case I’ll only include the note URL date and slug for security reasons in the “Related Amazon notes” section of the note.</li>
</ol>
